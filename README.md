# YouTube Downloader
 A web based python application to download youtube videos


## Using the application
* Clone GitHub repository
* Download required dependencies: ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt``` (If there is an issue when installing streamlit, try switching to Python 3.7)
* [Install ffmpeg and add it to your path](https://www.wikihow.com/Install-FFmpeg-on-Windows)
* Run `init.py`

(If you get a cipher error, that is an error with pytube that should be fixable with [this](https://github.com/nficano/pytube/pull/643/files))
